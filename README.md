# üöó CO‚ÇÇ Emissions & Vehicle Efficiency Analysis

This project analyzes a real-world dataset of vehicle specifications, fuel consumption, and CO‚ÇÇ emissions to support environmental policy, guide consumer choices, and uncover insights on fuel efficiency and emission patterns across different vehicle types and engine sizes.

## üìä Dataset Overview

The dataset (`CO2_Emission.csv`) includes the following features:

| Column                          | Description |

| `Make`                          | Manufacturer of the vehicle |
| `Model`                         | Vehicle model name |
| `Vehicle_Class`                | Vehicle type (e.g., SUV, Compact) |
| `Engine_size` (L)              | Engine displacement in liters |
| `Cylinders`                    | Number of engine cylinders |
| `Transmission`                | Transmission code (e.g., AS8, M6) |
| `Fuel_Consumption_in_City`    | Fuel usage in city driving (L/100km) |
| `Fuel_Consumption_in_City_Hwy`| Fuel usage on highways (L/100km) |
| `Fuel_Consumption_comb`       | Combined average fuel consumption |
| `CO2_Emissions` (g/km)        | CO‚ÇÇ emitted per kilometer |
| `Smog_Level`                   | Air pollution level from vehicle emissions |

## üß† Project Goals

- **Environmental policy**: Identify high-emission vehicle types and trends to support regulation.
- **Consumer support**: Highlight eco-friendlier vehicles based on emissions and efficiency.
- **Engineering insights**: Understand how engine size, transmission, and vehicle class impact emissions.

## üîç Key Questions Answered

### Emissions & Environmental Impact
- What is the average CO‚ÇÇ emission across all vehicle classes?
- Which vehicle classes emit the most and least CO‚ÇÇ on average?
- How have emissions changed by `Model_year`?
- What is the distribution of smog levels across vehicle classes?
- How does `Smog_Level` correlate with fuel consumption and emissions?

### Vehicle Efficiency & Engine Performance
- Which vehicles have the lowest CO‚ÇÇ emissions and highest fuel efficiency?
- Do automatic or manual transmissions have better fuel economy?
- Which makes/models offer the best balance of engine performance and low emissions?
- Which vehicles fall below the eco-friendly threshold of 150 g/km?

### Technical & Classification Insights
- How does fuel consumption (city vs highway) vary with engine size?
- Do smaller engines (<2.0L) consistently produce lower emissions?
- Which vehicle class has the highest average highway fuel efficiency?
- Can we classify vehicles as ‚ÄúEco-Friendly‚Äù vs ‚ÄúHigh Emission‚Äù?

## ü§ñ Machine Learning: CO‚ÇÇ Emission Classification

To automate eco-friendliness labeling, a **Classifier** was built, using a pie chart to visually display eco friendly and highu emission vehicl classes.

### üè∑Ô∏è Labeling Criteria
- **Eco-Friendly**: CO‚ÇÇ emissions < 150 g/km
- **High Emission**: CO‚ÇÇ emissions ‚â• 150 g/km

### üõ† Model Pipeline- To build a regression model to predict CO2 Emissions based on different vehicle features.
1. **Feature Engineering**: Transmission type derived from code prefixes (e.g., A8 ‚Üí Automatic).
2. **Preprocessing**: One-hot encoding for categorical features.
3. **Train-Test Split**: 70/30
4. **Model**: Random Forest Regressor (`sklearn`)
5. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - **Accuracy**: `0.96`
   - High precision and recall across both classes

### üß† Key Features Used
- `Engine_size`
- `Fuel_Consumption_comb`
- `Vehicle_Class`
- `Transmission_Type`
- `CO2_Emissions`

## üìà Visualizations

Visuals generated using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`:
- Line chart: CO‚ÇÇ emission trends over time
- Bar chart: Fuel consumption by transmission type
- Boxplot: Emissions by vehicle class
- Scatter plot: Engine size vs fuel consumption
- Histogram: Smog level distribution

Data summaries are export-ready for interactive dashboards in **Power BI** or **Tableau**.
